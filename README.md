## Hi, I'm Danielle Lazzara ✨
### AI Agent Developer | Python & React | Engineering Logic-Driven Workflows & Intelligent Agents

I am an **AI Developer** and **Systems Architect** dedicated to building logic-driven automations. I integrate a career-long expertise in systems design to engineer **Python-based agents** and **React applications** that transform manual bottlenecks into scalable, high-impact ROI.


## 🦋 Featured Project: AI Automation Simulator

While **The Secret Garden** (Coming Soon) highlights my creative UI/UX approach, this project demonstrates the **technical logic and architectural side** of my workflow development. It is a live, functional tool designed to diagnose business inefficiencies and propose data-driven AI solutions.

* **The Project:** A Python-based [AI Automation Simulator](https://lazzara-automation-simulator.streamlit.app/) that allows users to input business bottlenecks—such as manual data entry or slow lead responses—and receive a tailored automation strategy including tech stack recommendations.
* **Skills Demonstrated:** **Python Development**, **Logic Mapping**, **Streamlit Web Framework**, and **Root Cause Analysis (RCA)**.
* **Technical Execution:** Built using **Python** and deployed via **Streamlit Community Cloud**, utilizing structured data validation to simulate real-world business impact.
* **Tools Used:** **Python**, **Streamlit**, **VS Code**, and **GitHub**.
