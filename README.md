## Hi, I'm Danielle Lazzara ✨
### AI/ML E-commerce & Digital Experience Specialist | Bridging Automation, Design, and Revenue Growth

I am a highly analytical, creative, and strategic professional focused on crafting **end-to-end e-commerce solutions** and high-converting websites. My goal is to leverage **Generative AI** and complex workflows (Zapier, Make) to drive quantifiable revenue growth and improved customer engagement.

## 🦋 Featured Project: The Secret Garden Workflow Simulator - **COMING SOON**
This signature project showcases my entire skillset—from human-centered design to technical execution and documentation.

* **The Project:** An interactive **Figma Prototype** where a user navigates through an automation solution tailored to a business problem (e.g., slow workflows). The simulator uses holographic UI to visualize the solution and technical specs.
* **Skills Demonstrated:** **Figma Prototyping** (Holographic UI/UX), **Notion Documentation** (RCA & Technical Specs), **User-Centered Design**, and **Next.js** deployment.
* **Tools Used:** **VS Code**, **GitHub**, Figma, Notion, Next.js.
