## Hi, I'm Danielle Lazzara ✨
#### AI Automation & Creative Systems Designer | Bridging Design, Data, and Scalable Workflows

I am a heart-led systems designer and automation specialist who loves turning scattered data into clear, intuitive workflows. My focus is on crafting user-centered solutions and embedding efficiency across systems.

### 🦋 Featured Project: The Secret Garden Workflow Simulator

This signature project showcases my entire skillset—from human-centered design to technical execution and documentation.

* **The Project:** An interactive **Figma Prototype** where a user chooses a business problem (e.g., slow workflows, inconsistent CRM). The simulator then guides them through the automation solution, visualized with holographic UI, soft glows, and a "Secret Garden" design aesthetic.
* **Skills Demonstrated:** **Figma Prototyping** (Holographic UI/UX), **Notion Documentation** (RCA & Technical Specs), **Workflow Mapping**, and **User-Centered Design**.
* **Tools Used:** **VS Code, GitHub, Figma, Notion, Next.js** (for final deployment).
